            NSBE at New York University

Our chapter was founded in 1979 and ever since has been taking the organization by storm. Our membership has brought the organization three national chairs, three of the last five regional chairs, and two zone chairs.

At NYU-Poly NSBE, our membership is a family of many different faces and we welcome all who want to help to fulfill our mission statement; "To increase the number of culturally responsible black engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community".

Through our programs we study, perform community service, socialize, and grow together. Throughout the year our members gain skills that help them become leaders in our organization and in life through workshops on topics such as time management, study skills, and talking to recruiters. While at our meetings they are informed on NSBE history and tools that help make our organization a success, such communicating across different personality and leadership styles and setting S.M.A.R.T. goals.

 

On the more leisurely side, we engage in social activities to alleviate some of the stress inherent in STEM education as well as increase retention by engendering a strong system of support.
